# Productivity App with Flask

_This is the first full project I created with Flask. The functionality is all there, but the optimization was a little too slow for servers. I decided it would be better to take it down and create a new app with the correct setup rather than try to troubleshoot this one, but here it is if you want to take a look_

This productivity app is written in Python using Flask framework. It allows users to add nested project files as well as nested tasks within the nested project files. The app also includes a separate to-do list and notes section.

## Features
- Users can create nested project files with nested tasks.
- To-do list to keep track of simple tasks.
- Notes section to keep track of ideas.
- Ability to link notes to tasks and projects for easy look-up.
- Labels can be added onto anything to easily group similar tasks, projects, and notes together.
- Customization options for labels, projects, notes, and tasks such as colors and images.

## Installation
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the source material from the GitHub repository.
